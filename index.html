        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Something that I think is important for you to know, I love
          challenges. I came to live in England speaking almost no English at
          all (bless her!). Was a massive change, as you can imagine. But a few
          years later here we are, good level of English and lots of different
          work experiences. Ok, but how is this relevant? Well, I'm resilient
          and persevering and have always worked as part of a team, something
          that I really like. I'm not afraid to get out of my comfort zone. I'm
          a fast learner and really focused. So, the experience that I still
          don't have I compensate with lots of other really important skills,
          don't you think? Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my
          website and for reading all of this!! I appreciate it! You'll find
          below my contact details and my social media.
